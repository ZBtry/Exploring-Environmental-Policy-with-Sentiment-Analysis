Please see DevPost for detailed description.

Running the script is not necessary, as it used to gather data for analysis. 
You'll find the relevant raw data in the two text files `results_-0.5_or_less.txt` and `results_0.5_or_more.txt`. Their significance is explained in DevPost.
If you still want to run the script yourself use `pip install textblob` in your virtual environment, then run `main.py`
