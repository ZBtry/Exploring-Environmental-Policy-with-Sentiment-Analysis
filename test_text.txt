Bats are unusual among small mammals because they are long-lived. An individual bat living up
to 15 years is not uncommon and the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) is known to live over
30 years. In general, bats also have a low reproductive rate. Most species have only one young per
year. A few species such as the pallid bat, hoary bat, and western red bat have twins or multiple
births. Females are often 2 years old before they reach reproductive maturity and breeding females
are usually behaviorally sensitive to disturbance. As a result of low reproductive rates, maternity
colonies that are affected by temporarily-reduced fecundity or mortality, including transportation
project activities, may require multiple years to recover following a disturbance event (See case
studies in Section 8).
2.3 Roosting Ecology
Bats use multiple roost types and the inhabitation of each type varies temporally and seasonally.
Common characteristics to all roosts include an appropriate temperature regime, protection from
predators and inclement weather, and proximity to foraging sites. By roosting in a colony, bats
conserve energy through thermoregulation, have increased mating opportunities and maternal care,
have greater numbers of communication with other bats, and are likely to have less competition
for food from other vertebrate species (Altringham 2011). These roost sites may occur in crevices,
cavities, and foliage. The roosting patterns for California bat species are provided in Table 2-1.
Roost site selection and use, structural features of roosts, and the importance of bridges as roosting
habitat for bats are discussed below.
Roost site selection and use. The primary criteria for roost site selection are diurnal and seasonal
temperature patterns. Bats are unusual among mammals because they are heterothermic, meaning
their body temperature is variable. Although they are capable of thermoregulating like other
mammals, bats also have the capacity to allow their body temperatures to follow ambient
temperatures in a manner similar to many cold-blooded animals. In general, bats seek thermally-
buffered roost sites with stable temperatures over time and a lower range in temperature fluctuation
throughout the day and night when compared to the surrounding environment. In the summer while
raising young, bats often seek warm, but thermally-buffered, environments. These settings provide
enough thermal diversity for bats to maintain a fairly constant body temperature regime by simply
moving to areas with different temperatures. In the winter, especially in areas where temperatures
frequently drop below freezing, bats seek thermally stable roosts that are ideally just a couple of
degrees above freezing in which to hibernate. In most regions of California, where temperatures
rarely drop below freezing, bats typically seek cool roosts that do not substantially fluctuate in
temperature. This behavior enables bats to save energy by using torpor, which allows their body
temperatures to drop below their normal temperatures when active (Salinas et al. 2014).
Bats change roosts seasonally. Although the timing of roost changes varies with species and
geographic location, bats generally form maternity colonies in the spring. These aggregations are
maintained until the young are independent, which usually occurs in the late summer or early fall.
During this maternity season, adult males typically roost alone or less commonly in bachelor
colonies.
In the fall, some California species, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and the western red bat,
migrate regionally—often less than 200 miles—to milder climates, and use roosts for short periods
as migratory stop-over sites (Johnston 1998, Johnston and Whitford 2009). Hoary bats, however,
migrate long distances between their summer pupping areas and their wintering areas along the
California coast; these migrations may exceed 1,000 miles. Other species, such as the pallid bat,
remain within the same general area year-round, hibernate or lower their body temperature by
entering shallow torpor, and maintain a low level of activity throughout the winter (Johnston et al.
2018). For most species, little is known about their migratory movements.
Although large hibernating aggregations are common in some parts of the United States, they are
relatively rare in California. The largest hibernating aggregations have been found only in caves
and mines. However, aggregations of more than 1,000 non-hibernating Mexican free-tailed bats
have been observed overwintering in bridges along the California Coast and in portions of the
Central Valley (Johnston 1998). For example, the Alameda Creek Bridge on Interstate 880 (I-880)
in Alameda County provides overwintering habitat for approximately 1,000 Mexican free-tailed
bats, most of which leave in late February or early March. This bridge is close enough to the San
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 2-7 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
Francisco Bay that winter temperatures remain relatively cool with little fluctuation. These bats
likely fly to the Central Valley, where summer nights are warm and there are presumably high
concentrations of insects as prey (Johnston 1998). Most California bat species roost singly or in
small groups when hibernating during the winter. During the summer months maternity colonies
roost in conditions that are very warm and thermally stable. Roosts typically receive solar radiation
that warms the roost for crevice-roosting bats. In the winter, bats seek conditions which remain
cool and do not warm up during the day (Altringham 2011). For the State Route (SR) 91 Santa
Ana River Bridge Widening Project in Riverside County, LSA bat specialist Jill Carpenter reported
that bats roosted in the bat boxes that were situated on the outer concrete I-beams and usually
received solar radiation during part of each day (Carpenter pers. comm. 2018). During the winter
months, the bats used bat boxes located centrally under the bridge where temperatures were cooler
and more constant.
Bats are most active and raise their young during the summer. During this season bats
frequently use one roost during the day where they sleep and rear their young and another roost at
night for resting, digesting, and socializing. Occasionally bats will day roost outside of a crevice
in an area more typical of a night roost; however, this is uncommon and makes bats more
vulnerable to predation. Day roosts tend to be cryptic, concealed, and not always “predictable” in
their location. When crevice roosting bats choose a tree for day roosting, the tree is usually greater
than 12 inches diameter at breast height and more than 40 feet tall (Rancourt et al. 2007). However,
bats can exhibit a certain amount of flexibility, and in Plumas National Forest, a small maternity
colony of five female pallid bats used a small sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) cavity only 5 feet
above the ground as a day roost (Johnston and Gworek 2006). In contrast, night roosts tend to be
more open or exposed, are relatively easier for bat biologists to locate, and are typically close to
foraging habitat.
Little is known about roost requirements specific to mating. Some winter day roosts are used
specifically for the purposes of mating, as in the case of the cave-dwelling California leaf-nosed
bat (Macrotus californicus) (Brown and Berry 1994), but it is generally assumed that most other
California bats, such as the pallid bat, mate primarily in their unspecialized fall and winter roosts
(Johnston et al. 2006). Additionally, some night roosts are used as swarming areas where bats may
investigate the suitability of overwintering sites, give that year’s offspring information about the
locations of overwintering sites, and bring males and females from multiple colonies together to
increase genetic diversity (Altringham 2011). All the vespertilionids (i.e., mouse-eared bats) and
the California leaf-nosed bat mate during fall and winter but females do not become pregnant until
the spring as these bats exhibit a delayed fetal development. Molossids (i.e., free-tailed bats), such
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 2-8 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
as the Mexican free-tailed bat, usually mate in late winter or early spring. All California bats give
birth to babies sometime from mid-spring to mid-summer, depending upon the local climate.
Structural features of roosts. North American bat species use three general categories of roost
structures: crevices, caverns, and foliage. Table 2-1 lists the roosting patterns of California bat
species. Although some bat species appear to be obligate cavern or crevice dwellers, there is a
continuum between crevices and caverns, and many species use a range of roosts. In natural
settings, cavernous roosting species aggregate on open surfaces inside dark chambers, such as
caves or large tree hollows. Crevice roosting species occupy a variety of narrow slots (e.g., rock
crevices, exfoliating tree bark, and damaged wood in snags). With the exception of a few foliage
roosting species, North American bats also roost in cave-like spaces and/or crevices in
anthropogenic structures, including occupied or abandoned buildings, old mine workings, silos,
towers, tunnels, and bridges. Mines and caves are especially important for several special-status
species such as the Townsend’s big-eared bat, California leaf-nosed bat, fringed myotis, and less
frequently, pallid bat.
Species that roost in cliff faces and rock crevices are often found along highway corridors and
rocky banks near bridges in the Sierra Nevada and the Coast Ranges, particularly on highways that
follow major rivers. Several bat species roost in tree cavities or under flaking bark, in structural
flaws that are commonly found in conifer snags, and in live, mature cottonwoods (Populus spp.),
sycamores (Platanus racemosa), and oaks (Quercus spp.). These tree roosts can occur within the
road right-of-way, particularly along stream and river corridors. Foliage roosting species are often
concentrated in stands of mature riparian trees such as cottonwoods and sycamores. The long-
eared myotis has been detected roosting in crevices among rock slope protection material used for
rock revetment at bridges that span streams (Rainey and Pierson 1996). California myotis and
Yuma myotis have also been observed roosting in the rock revetment that surrounds a rock bridge
in the East San Jose hills (Dave Johnston pers. obs. 2011).
2.4 Foraging Ecology
Although bat species show some specialization for particular foraging styles and habitats, they
also will opportunistically exploit locally abundant prey (Johnston and Fenton 2001, Whitaker
1994). Diet studies conducted along the upper Sacramento River showed that while there were
marked differences in average diet composition across species, several species took advantage of
substantial hatches of particular insects, such as winged termites and caddisflies (Rainey and
Pierson 1996).
Studies in Canada (Grindal et al. 1999) and the Sierra Nevada (Pierson et al. 2001) found that bat
activity was concentrated over water in forested areas of western North America. The Yuma
myotis feeds largely on emergent aquatic insects by skimming near the surface of lacustrine (e.g.,
lakes or ponds with still water) or slow-moving waters; the little brown myotis also forages over
lacustrine waters but at slightly greater distances above the surface (Herd and Fenton 1983). These
two myotis species forage over small creeks and large, open lakes. Bat species divide potential
foraging space in ways that can be partially predicted from their wing size and shape, which
determine flight speed and maneuverability (Fenton and Bogdanowicz 2002). The Mexican free-
tailed bat, which has long, narrow wings, typically forages at slightly greater heights and much
faster speeds than the Yuma myotis, which gleans prey off the water’s surface and can also forage
in much smaller spaces (D. Johnston, unpublished data). Multiple bat species forage primarily
along the water’s edge and in adjacent riparian vegetation. However, some species such as the
western small-footed bat (Myotis ciliolabrum) are also known to forage exclusively away from
water, including along dry creek channels, within forest canopies, or in oak savanna. All of these
foraging habitats may occur near bridges and other transportation structures.
2.5 The Importance of Bridges to Bats
The relative importance of bridges to bats can be attributed to a combination of factors. Bridges
frequently have structural features that are analogous to natural roosts. The large mass of concrete
provides bats with a thermally buffered environment that enables regulation of their body
temperature (Smith and Stevenson 2013). Bridges over water and natural habitat are more likely
to be used by bats than bridges that span roadways and other developed areas. However, when
present, bats roosting over roadways or development are typically less sensitive to issues relating
to urbanization, such as the Mexican free-tailed bat and to a lesser degree, Yuma myotis. Some
southern California bridges that span other roadways, such as the West Prado Overhead Bridge on
SR 91 in Riverside County, have very large Mexican free-tailed bat colonies.
Keeley and Tuttle (1999) conducted an extensive investigation of bat species’ use of bridges
throughout 25 states in the continental United States and found that only 1% of surveyed structures
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 2-10 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
had ideal conditions for day roosting habitat. This study also concluded that a much higher
percentage of bridges could provide habitat for bats with relatively little or no extra cost for a given
project. The results of the study suggested that most species chose to roost in concrete crevices
that were sealed at the top, at least 6–12 inches deep, 0.5–1.25 inches wide, 10 feet or more above
ground, and typically not located over busy roadways (Keeley and Tuttle 1999).
Bridges have become important roosting habitat for Mexican free-tailed bats and other bat species
(Bennett et al. 2008). Because bridges have provided bats with a new roosting habitat where insect
prey are typically plentiful along water courses, bridges are likely responsible for greatly
increasing populations of Mexican free-tailed bats and Yuma myotis (Johnston 2012). In many
cases, when surveys are conducted within a 9–15-mile radius of a bridge roost, the bridge supports
the most significant, and in some cases the only, population of a particular species in the area.
Several colonies have resided in the same bridges for many years and have come to depend on
these structures as the only suitable habitat available to them in a particular area. This is
particularly true in areas where surrounding natural habitats have been degraded or eliminated,
such as the loss of riparian forests in the Central Valley.
Bridges and culverts have structural features that provide roosting sites for both crevice and cavern
dwelling bats (Table 2-2). Crevice roosts, which are suitable for day roosting maternity colonies,
are most frequently found in expansion and hinge joints, in abutment crevices, and in spaces
formed at the junction between old and new portions of a widened bridge. Less commonly,
crevices occur where a bridge, or more typically a viaduct, interfaces with rock features in the road
cut. Anomalous features, such as crevices behind signs on bridges, can also provide roosting
habitat. Bats that typically use crevices in bridges are listed in Table 2-1. Cave dwelling species
can also use bridges as day roosts. The most commonly occurring cavernous habitat on bridges
can be found in abutments, particularly where the slope meets the abutment in a configuration that
provides a cave-like space. For example, the abutment spaces on each end of the Sweetwater River
Bridge on SR 79 in San Diego County had a roosting Townsend’s big-eared bat, which is an
obligate cave roosting species.
Unscreened weep holes can become access points to cavernous habitat that is created in bridges
with closed box girder type construction. At the time that the 2004 Guidance Manual was prepared,
bat species were known to only occasionally access these large cavities in bridges. These species
included the Townsend’s big-eared bat, big brown bat, and Yuma myotis (Erickson et al. 2003).
During the surveys for this project, ecologists Dr. Dave Johnston and Kim Briones, M.S., observed
many hundreds of Mexican free-tailed bats pouring out of weep holes in the Lake Hodges Bridge
on I-15 in San Diego County (Photo 2-1). The Mexican free-tailed bat has shown evidence of
social learning (Kerth 2008) and in California has demonstrated seasonal movements among
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 2-11 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
regions within the state (Johnston 1998). This roosting behavior could spread throughout this
species’ range to bridges where the thermodynamics are conducive to roosting. The Mexican free-
tailed bat has also been observed accessing weep holes to roost in closed box girder bridge cavities
in Monterey County (Tatarian pers. comm. 2019), albeit in lesser numbers. Many older bridges
have hollow piers with openings to their interiors, and these cavities could accommodate large
numbers of bats.
Photo 2-1. Roosting habitat at Lake Hodges Bridge with a weep hole access to
cavern habitat for day roosting inside the box girder construction, a closure
pour used for night roosting, and an add-on panel for day roosting habitat for
crevice roosting bats.
Night roosts are most commonly found in concrete girder bridges in areas where the girders create
warm air pockets and where the temperature under the bridge deck is typically warmer, and more
stable, than the ambient temperature (Perlmeter 1996, 2004; Pierson et al. 1996). These sites
generally offer bats protection from weather and predators. Additionally, because bats forage most
frequently in association with water, and many bridges span water bodies, these sites have the
distinct advantage of offering proximity to foraging areas.

Section 3. Conservation Status of Bats
This section describes the conservation issues affecting bat species as they relate to California
transportation projects and discusses prioritization of species for conservation. There are 25 bat
species in California, 18 of which are rare and/or considered Species of Special Concern (SSC) by
CDFW, species of concern by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), or sensitive species
by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS). All 25 of these bat species are known to have behavioral and
ecological interactions with transportation structures, and can potentially be affected by
transportation projects, especially those involving bridges. Bats, like other wildlife, respond at the
population and individual levels to large-scale anthropogenic changes in ecosystems and
landscapes. Each bat species responds differently to anthropogenic stressors; some species respond
positively, but many respond negatively (Altringham 2011). California bat populations face many
challenges and the primary issues for bat conservation include: (1) loss, fragmentation, and
degradation of habitat; (2) pollution from chemicals, light, and noise; (3) predation and
interspecific competition; (4) introduced diseases, particularly White-nose Syndrome; (5) climate
change; (6) vehicular collisions; and (7) human disturbance, which includes many of the
aforementioned issues. The discussion presented below will focus on the conservation issues most
relevant to bridge and culvert projects and will briefly review the other issues.
3.1 Loss, Fragmentation, and Degradation of Habitat
Bridge replacement, new bridge construction, highway realignments, and new highway corridors
have the potential to contribute to the loss, fragmentation, and degradation of bats’ roosting and
foraging habitats. These impacts present the most serious threats to bat populations from
transportation projects, particularly when the affected habitat is used for roosting; bat roosting
habitat is considered a relatively scarce resource (Fenton 1997). Transportation projects can also
eliminate foraging areas (e.g., removal of riparian vegetation) or fragment foraging habitat (e.g.,
routing a road through a line of trees where bats concentrate their foraging). Transportation
projects can also change the hydrology of nearby water bodies by converting areas of a fast-moving
stream that provides specific emergent insect prey to slow-moving flat water that provides for a
whole different set of emergent insect prey (or vice-versa), and therefore change the bat species
foraging at these habitats. Studies in forest habitats suggest that bat species diversity (the
abundance of each species represented) drops substantially when habitats are disturbed, while
species richness (actual number of species represented) may stay the same (Fenton et al. 1992,
Medellin et al. 2000). In central California, both species diversity and species richness declined as
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-2 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
the density of roads increased; the density is a metric of human density and the fragmentation and
degradation of bat habitat (Whitford 2008). Habitat complexity and species richness have declined
over time, which results in humans accepting certain levels of habitat degradation during their
lifetime as normal conditions (e.g., lower background levels of bats). This acceptance of changes
to intact habitats is repeated in successive generations and is a sociological phenomenon termed
shifting baseline syndrome (Soga and Gaston 2018). Most of California’s natural environment has
long been in decline, with much of the state no longer supporting habitat for many sensitive bat
species.
3.2 Pollution from Chemicals, Light, and Noise
3.2.1 Chemicals
Pollutants from construction waste that are introduced into drinking water sources for roosting
bats, as well as exhaust emissions from construction equipment and vehicles, can result in adverse
effects on bats during the implementation of transportation projects. Although both of these effects
are generally considered temporary because they are associated with the construction phase, they
are sometimes overlooked.
3.2.2 Light
Light pollution on a regional scale can be defined as the changing of natural light levels in the
nocturnal landscape as a result of artificial lighting (Falchi et al. 2011). Thus, light pollution on a
landscape scale is mostly the result of urbanization and is increasing by 6% per year (Holker et al.
2010). Artificial lighting was found to extend the foraging period of diurnal insectivorous birds by
a few hours, which created interspecific competition with several insectivorous bats (Rich and
Longcore 2006). Although some bat species are attracted to lights, many species are repelled by
them (Rowse et al. 2016). Additionally, nearly all California bats are insectivorous, and insects are
strongly influenced by artificial lighting. There is substantial variation among artificial lighting
types regarding the compounds or technologies used and the ranges of wavelengths emitted.
Common types of artificial lighting include incandescent, mercury vapor, low pressure sodium,
high pressure sodium, metal halide, and light-emitting diode (LED). Partly because insects respond
very differently to each kind of lighting, bats’ attraction to different lighting types also varies.
Thus, the effects of artificial lighting on bats are species-specific and highly dependent on the type
of lighting.
In addition to the brightness of light, its wavelength also affects bats’ behavior. Humans see
wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers (nm) (i.e., visible light spectrum), while many
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-3 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
insects can see in the ultraviolet range of 10 to 400 nm and most bats likely see ultraviolet light
between 335 and 395 nm (Gorresen et al. 2015). Therefore, bats perceive light differently than
humans. Because there has been relatively little research on the effects of different types of lighting
on North American bats, it remains difficult to ascertain how much a bat or bat colony might be
affected by artificial lighting.
Light pollution at a microhabitat level, such as on a bridge structure, usually involves specific light
sources that can potentially result in direct impacts on bats and their roosting habitat. Most lighting
on bridges is confined to the top deck and lamp posts are typically located along its edges. The
lighting is directed on the road and is also angled away from the bridge on both sides. In some
settings, the areas below the bridge are illuminated to provide visibility along pedestrian pathways
or for vehicular traffic if the bridge spans another road. Although uncommon, lighting from a
bridge deck may also shine directly on the soffits (undersides) of an adjacent bridge where bats
could potentially emerge from expansion joints. Any direct or indirect artificial lighting has the
potential to degrade or eliminate roosts or potential roosting habitat.
3.2.3 Noise
Bats are acutely sensitive to changes in their sound environment and can react to even relatively
quiet noise if it is foreign to them and stimulates a stress response (Altringham and Kerth 2016).
Additionally, the frequency of the noise is also important because individual species of bats have
different sensitivities to various noise frequencies. Nearly all of California’s bats are insectivorous,
and with the exception of a few species, such as the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus), use high-
frequency echolocation to detect prey and orient themselves within the landscape. Bats also use
sound to communicate, especially while flying. Different species of bats will respond differently
to human-induced noise and noise will affect certain bat behaviors differently, such as foraging
versus roosting (Caltrans 2016).
Although traffic along a bridge may generate enough noise to disrupt bats’ foraging ability
adjacent to the bridge, much of their foraging will typically be far enough away from an occupied
bridge roost that traffic noise is not a disruption. Further, most of the sounds generated from traffic
tend to be low frequency, which except for the pallid bat, should not affect bats’ abilities to locate
prey. Pallid bats detect prey by passively listening to low frequency sounds generated by the prey
(Bell 1982, Johnston and Fenton 2001) so traffic may affect this species’ ability to forage near
noise pollution. Allen et al. (2010) measured cortisol levels in roosting Brazilian free-tailed bats
(Tadarida brasiliensis brasiliensis) in very noisy bridges and in remote caves without much human
disturbance and found that bats roosting in noisy bridges had similar cortisol levels to their
counterparts in quiet caves. Bats in noisy bridges did not show elevated levels of cortisol,
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-4 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
suggesting that these bats didn’t experience additional stress from the noise. Thus, these bats
seemed to be unaffected by the noise from traffic activity on bridges. However, noise from
construction activities can potentially disturb roosting bats to the point that they abandon their
roost. Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii) are so sensitive to noise disturbance
that they are known to abandon their young when disturbed (Pierson and Rainey 1994).
At a construction project in a large urban park, a maternity colony of big brown bats (Eptesicus
fuscus) tolerated high decibel (dB) levels of low frequency sounds (audible to humans) generated
by chain saws (75–86 dB) and large graders (85–89 dB) within 100 feet of their maternity roost,
but the colony abandoned their roost when workers used a high-frequency (19–28 kilohertz [kHz])
laser surveying instrument, inaudible to the human ear (Johnston et al. 2018). Although high
frequencies attenuate to ambient sound in shorter distances than lower frequencies, the noise from
equipment should be measured for corresponding frequencies to which the bat species involved
are most sensitive. For example, in order to determine appropriate buffer zones for operating
equipment near an active big brown bat roost, the dB of the 20 kHz frequency (the frequency that
the big brown bat is most sensitive to) of noise and distance needed before the noise attenuated to
ambient sound would need to be measured. See Sections 6 and 7 for more discussion on
determining impacts and developing mitigation. Caltrans (2016) also provides guidance and good
discussions about noise impacts to bats at transportation projects.
Most construction noise is low frequency and within a range of low auditory sensitivity for many
bat species. However, potential adverse effects on bats from construction noise include roost
abandonment and the interruption or impediment of bats’ abilities to use echolocation for foraging
or navigation around bridges. Noise disturbance and displacement of bats from roosts or important
foraging areas can potentially result in reduced survivability of individuals from increased
susceptibility to predation, reduced quality of thermal and social environments, and decreased
foraging efficiencies. During the development of impact assessments and avoidance and
minimization measures for the effects of construction noise on bats, the frequency of noise
generated and the hearing sensitivity of the bat species at risk should be considered.
3.3 Predation and Interspecific Competition
Bats roosting on and emerging from bridges may be susceptible to predation due to their large
concentrations. In California, bats have few predators, but may be susceptible to owls, hawks,
snakes, and domestic cats (Lefevre 2005, Sommer et al. 2009, Mikula et al. 2016). Peregrine
falcons (Falco peregrinus) in particular hunt bats in flight in California (Peeters and Peeters 2005).
Other raptor species such as the American kestrel (Falco sparverius) and barn owl (Tyto alba)
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-5 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
have been observed roosting on California bridges and are known to capture Mexican free-tailed
bats as they leave their bridge roosts (Dave Johnston, pers. obs. 2001). Nonnative rats (Rattus
rattus) are also known to prey on bats in roosts in cavernous habitat (Fellers 2000), which
sometimes occurs in the space between the abutments and the bank slopes of bridges. Other
species, such as American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), have been known to capture bats but
these observations are relatively rare. Additionally, bridges that provide nesting habitat for raptors
and ravens (Corvus corax) can lead to an increase in predation on bats from predatory birds.
Interspecific competition among bats is not well understood in North America. However, habitat
use studies of bats in northern Monterey County suggest that species which are more sensitive to
disturbance, including the hairy-winged bat (Myotis volans), are replaced by more tolerant species
such as Yuma myotis (Myotis yumanensis) or Mexican free-tailed bat (Whitford 2008).
3.4 White-Nose Syndrome
The primary introduced disease that exhibits the greatest risk to bats is White-nose Syndrome
(WNS), which is caused by a fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) and infects bats in
hibernation. This disease has spread rapidly from the state of New York, where it was first reported
in North America, to the state of Washington within 12 years. Genetic data suggests this disease
is widespread but uncommon in Europe, the likely source of the pathogen in North America. The
WNS fungus was detected in Chester, California in the spring of 2019 although as of July 2019
the WNS disease had not yet been detected in bats of California (CDFW 2019a). It is anticipated
that bats afflicted with WNS will soon be found in California; however, bats in most parts of
California do not enter the long periods of hibernation in cold (0–10°C), damp conditions
associated with the disease (Frick et al. 2010). The exceptions are bats that inhabit the high
elevations of the Sierra Nevada and northern high plateau areas, such as the caves in Lava Beds
National Monument. Species such as the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), which is especially
susceptible to the disease, hibernate in these cold, damp caves during winter months. Bridges built
in these and other geographic areas with cold winters (Building Climate Zone 16 of the California

in these areas at risk of infection.

3.5 Climate Change
The effects of climate change on bat populations is an emerging topic in bat conservation. Because
many of their life history traits (e.g., seasonal migration, distribution, hibernation, and
reproduction) are closely tied to local and regional temperature patterns, a changing climate is
expected to have important implications for many bat species. Effects of climate change on bats
may include shifts in regional distribution, changes in reproductive patterns such as the timing of
mating and delayed fertilization, declined reproductive success in semiarid regions where water
may be increasingly scarce, direct mortality from extreme weather events, reduced insect prey
base, and reduced biodiversity; only the most flexible species may be able to adjust to changing
conditions (Adams and Hayes 2008; Hughes et al. 2012; Loeb and Winters 2012; Aguiar et al.
2016; Grider et al. 2016; Stepanian and Wainwright 2018). Some effects of climate change on bats
have already been observed; shifts in seasonal migration times have been documented in an
Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) colony in Indiana (Pettit and O’Keefe 2017), and one of the nation’s
largest Mexican free-tailed bat colonies at Bracken Cave in Texas (Stepanian and Wainwright
2018). If or how climate change could affect bats in California, particularly bridge-dwelling bats,
is difficult to predict. In California, bridges primarily support bats during the maternity season but
spring, fall, and winter bridge roosting habitats are also important. The maternity season can be
defined as when pregnant females congregate at a roost to give birth and raise their young. The
maternity season is generally over when the year’s young are flying and begin foraging on their
own. Shifts in local migratory patterns and seasonal use of bridges could change the patterns of
bat use.
3.6 Vehicular Collisions
Transportation infrastructure such as roads and highways has substantially affected wildlife
through the direct casualties associated with vehicle collisions. Most research on vehicle-related
fatalities has focused on non-flying mammals, birds, and herptiles. However, with an increased
awareness of vehicular collisions with bats, more research is needed to understand this threat
(Lesinski 2007, Russel et al. 2009, Medinas et al. 2013). Vehicle-related bat casualties have been
linked to the proximity of roadways relative to commuting or foraging flyways (e.g., roads through
or alongside tree stands, riparian corridors), nearness to important roost sites such as maternity
roosts, time of year, species-specific flight behavior pattern (e.g., low-flying versus high-flying
pattern), age, and sex (Lesinski 2007, Gaisler et al. 2009, Medinas et al. 2013, Novaes et al. 2018).
Russell et al. (2009) examined the incidence of roadway bat casualties between a known little
brown myotis and Indiana bat roost site and associated foraging areas; the researchers estimated
that annual highway mortality accounted for as much as 5% mortality of the combined colonies.
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-7 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
Other studies have found a higher incidence of collision-related bat casualties in the late summer,
which may be attributed to the time when young of the year become volant (Gaisler et al. 2009).
Given that bridges provide important roost habitat for bats, and are thus an attractant for bats,
bridges could represent a casualty risk for bats that occupy these structures. This may be especially
true when vegetative growth blocks the aerial passage under the bridge, forcing bats to fly over
the bridge to access areas on the opposite side of the bridge as their roosts. Although not well-
studied, many transportation projects in Europe have developed mitigation for bats comprising
crossing structures, such as overpasses (e.g., bat gantries) or underpasses where known commuting
routes intersect roadways, in an attempt to safely guide bats over or under roadways (Berthinussen
and Altringham 2012, Elmeros et al. 2016). While underpasses appear to be more widely-used by
bats and thus, generally more effective, research results are inconsistent. More research and
monitoring are needed to fully assess the effectiveness of these mitigation structures.
3.7 Human Disturbance
Human disturbance is an important threat to bat conservation and can lead to roost abandonment,
or in the case of active maternity colonies of Townsend’s big-eared bats, direct mortality of young.
Though direct forms of human disturbance are a threat to bat populations, impacts associated with
indirect forms of human disturbance may represent a greater overall threat. Human disturbance
during critical periods, namely winter hibernation and maternity seasons, can have detrimental
effects on bat populations. For example, frequent arousals caused by cave visitations during the
winter hibernation season can result in reduced energy reserves and survival rates of hibernating
bats (Boyles and Brack Jr. 2009). During the maternity season, an increase in even a low level of
human disturbance can cause sensitive species, particularly the Townsend’s big-eared bat and
sometimes the pallid bat, to move to different roost sites or abandon roost sites altogether (Beck
and Rudd 1960, Pierson et al. 1988). In urban areas, bridge-roosting bats are especially vulnerable
to human disturbance because urban bridges are often an attractant for regular human activity,
including homeless encampments and vandalism. Common species, such as the Yuma myotis and
Mexican free-tailed bat, generally adapt to regularly occurring disturbance. However, bat colonies
that roost within the physical reach of humans become vulnerable to damage and possible
destruction.
3.8 Species Priorities for Conservation
Because bridge-roosting bat species have different sensitivities to disturbance and use bridges to
varying degrees, the following list identifies the levels of risk to these species. This list was
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-8 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
developed by the California Bat Working Group in 2007. The Highest Risk, Medium Risk, and
Lowest Risk categories indicate the level of risk to populations of these species as a result of
roosting in bridges. For example, the long-eared bat (Myotis evotis) is included in the Lowest Risk
category because a very low percentage of this species’ populations in California use bridges as
habitat. Thus, there is a very low likelihood that transportation projects will affect long-eared bat
populations. In contrast, the commonly occurring Yuma myotis is a riparian and waterway obligate
and a very high percentage of the species’ population uses bridges for maternity roosting habitat.
Therefore, populations of this species have been designated as being at the highest risk of impacts
due to transportation projects.
Highest Risk:
· Pallid bats — Impacts on day roosts and maternity roosts of this species in and on bridges are
fairly well-documented. In Johnston et al.’s 2004 study of three bridge projects with pre-
construction maternity colonies of pallid bats, none of the mitigation worked; after pallid bats
were excluded, no pallid bats returned to the new or retrofitted bridges with replacement
habitat. In this 2019 study, mitigation for lost habitat for pallid bats for 10 bridges and one
culvert was provided through replacement habitat; however, post-construction surveys suggest
only four of the bridges and the culvert now have pallid bat colonies. The pallid bat is a CDFW
SSC, and both subspecies (A. p. pacificus and A. p. pallidus) appear to be declining in
California and adjacent states (Johnston and Stokes 2007; Johnston 2017). In addition to the
loss of day roosting habitat for maternity colonies, the loss of night roosting habitat could also
pose a substantial threat to bat populations in certain situations as the result of bridge
replacement and retrofitting activities. An example situation involving night roosts is discussed
in Section 8 for Uvas Creek Bridge Project on SR 152 in Santa Clara County.
· Yuma myotis — This species occurs in colonies of up to 100 or more individuals on many
bridges near water throughout the state. The Yuma myotis is often considered an obligate
riparian species (Johnston et al. 2002) because it forages primarily on the surface, very near
the surface of water bodies, or within the riparian habitat on aquatic emergent insects (Brigham
et al. 1992). This species forages preferentially over still, open bodies of water, and thus may
benefit from reservoirs and slow-moving water associated with bridge projects (Herd and
Fenton 1983). At lower elevations this species frequently forms large colonies in culverts and
bridges over water, which exposes them to disturbances from bridge or culvert maintenance,
improvement, or replacement projects. Yuma myotis are increasing their populations because
of water management projects and because bridges often span watercourses and provide
maternity roosting habitat (Johnston 2012). Yuma myotis are considered at high risk because
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-9 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
a large percentage of their population occurs in bridges and culverts, which makes them
susceptible to habitat loss when bridges are retrofitted or replaced.
· Mexican free-tailed bats — This species is by far the most common and abundant species in
transportation structures, especially in bridges and causeways over or adjacent to waterways.
It is partly because of bridges that this species has been able to increase in numbers since the
beginning of the European colonization of California (Johnston 2012). Because of their affinity
to roost in anthropogenic structures, this species is also exposed to issues relating to bridge
replacement projects, bridge retrofits, and poor water quality associated with urban areas. For
example, when the Franklin Boulevard Causeway Bridge in Sacramento County was rebuilt,
40,000 bats had to be excluded from the structure (Johnston 2005). This colony represented a
very high percentage of the regional population. The project involved installing seven bat
condominiums that were intended to provide replacement maternity roosting habitat; however,
there were only 2,000 bats total at the peak occupancy for all seven bat condominiums
combined. Four years passed between the bats’ exclusion and when they had access to the new
bridge, suggesting that the majority of this large population was at risk in the interim. In
addition to bridge projects, natural disasters such as flooding or fires can also put these large
concentrated populations at risk when they roost in bridges.
Medium Risk:
· Townsend’s big-eared bats — This species occasionally day roosts in bridges with partially-
open abutments or open-ended box beams (Dave Johnston, and Kim Briones pers. obs., 2018;
Pierson and Fellers 1998). Maternity colonies of this species have long been known to be
extremely sensitive to increases in disturbance, and females have been documented
abandoning their young when disturbed (Humphrey and Kunz 1976). Some research suggests
that the species is reasonably tolerant of disturbance when no increase in the ambient levels of
noise disturbance occur, but more studies are needed to better understand tolerance levels and
the conditions of these disturbances and how they affect this species (CDFW 2016, Freeman
2012). The Townsend’s big-eared bat is a CDFW SSC.
· Big brown bats — This species occasionally uses expansion joints for day roosts in bridges,
and data from this study determined that big brown bat individuals will typically return to
mitigation roost habitat or retained roost habitat following disturbance (See Section 8). Big
brown bats are known to abandon roosts when construction activities include high frequency
noises between 20 and 30 kHz (H. T. Harvey & Associates 2006).
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-10 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
· Long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis), fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes), California myotis
(Myotis californicus), and long-legged myotis (Myotis volans), little brown myotis (Myotis
lucifugus), Canyon bat (Parastrellus hesperus) — These species night roost in small
numbers in bridges that often include closure pours or concrete girders which trap warm air at
night (typical night roosting habitat). However, they occasionally day roost on transportation
structures and their populations can be adversely affected through retrofitting or replacement.
Because they day roost only infrequently on these transportation structures, populations of
these species are considered at a medium risk of impacts associated with bridge and culvert
projects.
· Western mastiff bat (Eumops perotis) — This species occasionally roosts on bridges,
although it is more commonly found roosting on cliff faces. Road building along cliff faces, as
well as bridge construction or replacement, are considered a medium risk to this species
because there are relatively few roosts in California.
Lowest Risk:
· California leaf-nosed bats (Macrotus californicus) — A small maternity colony of this
cavernous roosting species was observed roosting on the California side of a bridge crossing
the Colorado River in 2016 (Brown pers. comm. 2018). Because of the rarity of this species
using bridges, risks to California leaf-nosed bats from implementation of bridge projects are
considered minimal.
· Western red bats (Lasiurus blossevillii) — This species day roosts in the foliage of trees.
Threats to this species from bridge and culvert projects are not well understood. However,
bridges are frequently situated across riparian areas and likely migratory routes for this species.
If these bridges are retrofitted or replaced, impacts on the trees adjacent to the bridge could
affect individuals of this species.
· Northern yellow bats (Lasiurus xanthinus) — Because this species typically roosts in palms
in the southernmost areas of the state, the likelihood of impacts on the species from
implementation of bridge projects is anticipated to be relatively low. If implementation of a
bridge project entails the removal of fan palms (Washingtonia spp.), which are potential
roosting habitat, there is a potential for direct impacts to individuals of this species.
· Silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) — This species is expected to occur in many
of the coniferous forests of California, and impacts from bridge-related projects are not well
understood. However, bridges are frequently situated through wooded areas and sometimes
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-11 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
across likely migratory routes for this species. Bridge projects may require trees adjacent to
the bridge to be removed, which could affect individuals of this species.
· Hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) — Because the hoary bat migrates vast distances from parts
of Mexico in the winter to more northern latitudes including Canadian forests in the summer,
this species may occur in a wide variety of landscapes and habitats. Like other foliage-roosting
species, any tree removal from the implementation of transportation projects could affect
individuals of this species but this is considered a low risk to its populations.
· Small-footed myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum) — This species is expected to occasionally roost
in bridges, but little is known about maternity colonies using bridges. Bridges are not expected
to regularly provide maternity roosting habitat for this species. Thus, populations of these
species are considered at a low risk of impacts associated with implementation of bridge
projects.
· Arizona myotis (Myotis occultus) — This species rarely occurs in California and is only
known from along the lower Colorado River. The last known maternity colony was
documented in a timber bridge prior to the bridge’s removal (Stager 1943). This species roosts
occasionally in bridges over watercourses in Arizona, which is in the central portion of its
range; however, it is expected to occur only rarely in California bridges because of its currently
retracted range. Therefore, transportation projects present only a low risk to the species in
California.
· Cave myotis (Myotis velifer) — This species occasionally day roosts in bridges in Arizona
but has not been detected day or night roosting on bridges in California. Therefore, any
potential risks to this species as a result of transportation projects in California would be
considered minimal.
· Mexican long-tongued bat (Choeronycteris mexicana) and lesser long-nosed bat
(Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) — These nectar feeding species are considered rare in California
but they are occasionally observed feeding on hummingbird feeders, ornamental plantings of
agave (Agave spp.), and the native Shaw’s agave (Agave shawii). Both species are cave or
grotto roosting bats but are not known to roost on bridges or culverts. Therefore any
transportation projects would likely be considered to have minimal impacts to this species as
long as agaves are not affected.
· Spotted bat (Euderma maculatum) — This species specializes on roosting on cliff faces or
caves situated on cliff faces. They are not known to roost on bridges or culverts and the
potential of impacts on this species from transportation projects is mostly limited to projects
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 3-12 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
involving high rocky cliffs. Thus, populations of these species are considered at a low risk of
impacts associated with bridge and culvert projects.
· Big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops macrotis) and pocketed free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops
femorosaccus) — These cliff roosting species occasionally night roost on bridges, but they
have very limited ranges in California. Potential risk from transportation projects along cliffs
or night roosting on bridges is considered minimal and would be considered a low risk to these
populations.

Section 4. Legal Regulations and Their
Implications for Projects
Although no bat species present in California is currently designated as threatened or endangered
under the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA) or the California Endangered Species Act
(CESA), 12 species of bats are designated as SSC by CDFW. The USFS includes three bat species
on its sensitive animal list for the Pacific Southwest Region, and the Western Bat Working Group
also identifies several species as high priority for consideration of conservation measures (Section
3). The regulatory agency most directly involved with bat conservation in California is CDFW.
The primary regulatory mechanism applicable to bats is CEQA, which requires an analysis of a
project’s effects on the environment, including biological resources such as bats.
There are no federally listed bats present in California at the time of preparation of this guidance
document (USFWS 2019a, 2019b). The lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae), which
was formerly federally listed as endangered, has been infrequently reported in southern California.
This species did not become part of the California fauna until nectar-producing plants were
established in landscaped areas, and it was delisted by USFWS in 2018. For states where federally
listed bat species regularly occur, FESA provides legislated protection against loss (take) of any
individuals, or the loss of any federally designated critical habitat as published in the Federal
Register. If a project has the potential to result in adverse effects to listed species, project
proponents initiate Section 7 or Section 10 consultation with the USFWS. The Section 7
consultation process is used for projects that are federal actions; Section 10 consultation applies to
non-federal actions. FESA provides a mechanism to mitigate the loss, or potential loss, of listed
species. Because many bat species’ habitats overlap, protection for federally listed bat species may
indirectly benefit other non-listed bat species.
No California bat species are listed as threatened or endangered, or candidates for listing, under
CESA at the time of preparation of this guidance document (CDFW 2019b). The Townsend’s big-
eared bat was a candidate for listing under CESA from November 9, 2012, through August 25,
2016. After a review of the best scientific information available, CDFW recommended to the
California Fish and Game Commission that listing of the species was not warranted. The
commission, in response to CDFW staff recommendation and after considering public comment,
voted not to list the species. CDFW ultimately recommends that all Townsend’s big-eared bat
maternity and hibernation roosts be considered habitat essential for the continued existence of the
species. This recommendation was formulated as part of its status review for the Townsend’s big-
eared bat and is based on the susceptibility of roost structures to disturbance, degradation, and loss.

Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
Colonial roosting species, like many bats, also receive attention during the environmental review
for CEQA compliance because of the potential for individual projects to have population-level
impacts to a species, even relatively common or widespread species. The following sections
provide the regulatory setting for assessing potential impacts on bats through CEQA and discusses
their potential implications for Caltrans projects.
4.1 California Environmental Quality Act
CEQA serves as the regulatory framework through which California public agencies assess,
disclose, and mitigate significant environmental impacts from proposed projects requiring public
agency approval. Because CEQA compliance is the principal regulatory mechanism to protect bat
populations in California, the primary objective of protecting bats on bridges and culverts is to
avoid impacts through implementation of avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures.
Impacts on biological resources are typically considered significant if they would substantially
degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species,
cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant
or animal community, or substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of an endangered,
rare or threatened species (Public Resources Code [PRC], Section 21083; CEQA Guidelines in
Title 14, California Code of Regulations [CCR], Sections 15065[a][1] and 15206[b][5]). The
CEQA Guidelines identify rare, threatened, and endangered species as plants or animals already
listed by a governmental agency as being rare or endangered or that meet the definitions provided
in the CEQA Guidelines (Title 14, CCR, Section 15380). For example, CDFW designates rare
species, such as the pallid bat and Townsend’s big-eared bat, as SSC.
Caltrans, as the lead agency under CEQA, coordinates with CDFW, as a responsible agency under
CEQA, to determine if the effects of a proposed transportation project meets the criteria to be
considered significant under CEQA. If a project has the potential to result in significant impacts
on rare, threatened, or endangered species, the lead agency is required to prepare an Initial
Study/Negative Declaration (IS/ND), Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND), or
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to fully analyze those impacts. The Caltrans Project
Development Team (PDT) determines the type of CEQA document that will be prepared by
evaluating all potential environmental impacts, including those on non-biological resources, and
assessing whether mitigation is required to reduce the impacts to less-than-significant levels. The
biological resources section of the CEQA document is typically developed using a project’s
Natural Environment Study (NES) or NES Minimal Impact (NES-MI). The NES presents the
status of the regulatory agency consultation process and describes the avoidance and minimization
measures for biological resources. For example, the standard project avoidance and minimization
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 4-3 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
measures implemented when bat roosting habitat may be affected can vary from seasonal work
restrictions, such as avoiding work during the maternity season, to the use of temporary
exclusionary devices prior to and during the construction phase. If project impacts on bats are
identified as potentially significant even with the implementation of avoidance and minimization
measures, Caltrans may develop appropriate mitigation measures to reduce the level of the
impacts. Mitigation measures are typically based on habitat criteria as it is challenging to guarantee
species’ responses. Unfortunately, implementing mitigation measures for wildlife does not ensure
that they will be successful for the targeted wildlife. Even experienced bat biologists cannot
guarantee when prescribed mitigation measures will work as intended. Therefore, it is important
to clearly identify qualitative and quantitative goals and objectives in a mitigation and monitoring
plan and provide an adaptive management clause.
As a CEQA responsible agency, CDFW may require additional mitigation measures for bats prior
to issuing approvals such as a Lake and Streambed Alteration Agreement (LSAA), which is
discussed below, or incidental take permit for the project. Caltrans will incorporate the complete
set of mitigation measures into the mitigation and monitoring plan that will be implemented during
project activities; these measures will also be included in the project specifications and layouts.
Mitigation monitoring is intended to improve the success of mitigation, inform adaptive
management to meet success criteria, and improve the development of future mitigation measures
over time.
The Caltrans PDT determines if any of the project effects meet the criteria to be considered
significant under CEQA and determines the type of environmental document to prepare for each
project. If a project has the potential to result in significant effects on rare, threatened, or
endangered species, the lead agency is required to prepare an Initial Study/ Negative Declaration
(IS/ND) or if there is an actual impact resulting in mitigation an Initial Study/ Mitigated Negative
Declaration (IS/MND) or an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to fully analyze those impacts.
The ultimate determination regarding the type of CEQA documentation is based on an evaluation
of all potential project impacts, including impacts to non-biological resources. Because CEQA
compliance is the principal regulatory mechanism to protect bat populations in California, the
primary objective of protecting bats on bridges and other transportation infrastructure is to avoid
significant environmental effects under CEQA. Through efforts to avoid, minimize, and mitigate
for negative effects to bats from activities on the SHS, we can help avoid significant environmental
effects under CEQA.
During project planning, Caltrans evaluates the potential for species and their habitats to occur
within the proposed project area and subsequently assesses whether project activities would result
Caltrans Bat Mitigation: A Guide to Developing 4-4 H. T. Harvey & Associates
Feasible and Effective Solutions July 2019
in effects on species and/or their habitats. This evaluation may be described in the preparation of
a NES or NES-MI.
For bridge projects that have the potential to affect bats, Caltrans coordinates a site visit by a
qualified biologist to assess the potential habitat. Based on the findings of the site visit, additional
surveys for bats may be needed to identify which species are present. If implementing the bridge
project would result in adverse effects on bat species, an impact analysis would be developed,
typically in a NES to support the project’s environmental compliance. If mitigation is required for
significant impacts to bats, Caltrans would then develop and implement a bat mitigation plan.
CEQA requires monitoring to assess the success of mitigation measures. These measures are
typically based on habitat criteria as it is challenging to guarantee species’ responses. Mitigation
monitoring is an essential part of the CEQA process and is intended to improve the success of
mitigation, inform adaptive management to meet success criteria, and improve the development of
future mitigation measures over time. Unfortunately, implementing mitigation measures for
wildlife does not ensure that they will be successful for the targeted wildlife. Even experienced bat
biologists cannot guarantee when prescribed mitigation measures will work as intended. This
makes it very important to clearly identify qualitative and quantitative goals and objectives in the
mitigation plan or strategy and provide an adaptive management clause. Caltrans must ensure that
all standard or mitigation measures identified in the NES and the permits are incorporated into the
project specifications and layouts.
